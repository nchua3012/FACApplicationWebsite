    <h5>My Javascript Game</h5>
    <p>To practice what I've learnt about Javascript, I created a two-player fighting game. Play <a href="https://nchua3012.github.io/FACGameSubmission/" target="_blank" class="colored-link" >the game</a> & view my <a href="https://github.com/nchua3012/FACGameSubmission" target="_blank" class="colored-link" >Github repository.</a> </p>

    <h5>Key Learnings</h5>
    <p>As a starting point, I followed a guide video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ&t=8785s&ab_channel=ChrisCourses" target="_blank" class="colored-link">Chris Courses</a>. Following his tutorial allowed me to set up the basic framework and implement the basic fighting game mechanics of movement and attacking, as well as setting up the win conditions with JavaScript. </p>
    
    <p>Challenging aspects I encountered were:
    <li>Attack functions - Working on the various functions was particularly challenging as it required connecting the player inputs, collisions between hitboxes and character boxes as well as the correct sprites to be animated.
    <li>Sprite sheet positioning - Understanding the relationship between the character boxes/hit boxes and any offsets in X & Y positioning was also intially challenging and required a siginificant amount of time to solve. It required logging various positions as well as creating frames around all the seperate elements to debug all issues and create a functional system. 
    </p>

    <h5>Changes I've Made</h5>
    <p>Once my basic framework was created, I made some changes: 
    <li> Adding character facing directions according left or right inputs. This required the flipping of character sprites to the correct directions when a player inputs moving left or right. 
    <li> Code to integrate more complex sprite sheets with multiple rows and columns for smoother character animations.</li> 
    </p>
    <p>Looking ahead, I plan to make the following improvements as my understanding of Javascript continues to grow: 
        <li> Move styling and layout to CSS for better organization.
        <li> Adjustments to the character code to allow easier positioning edits.
        <li> Add more attacks and blocking mechanics to enhance gameplay. 
            
            </p>
