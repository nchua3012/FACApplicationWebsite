    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>
        Hello! I’m Nick Chua. I'm originally from Brunei and now based in the UK, where I’ve lived for the past 18 years. As a former architect, I’ve had the privilege of leading several large-scale development projects in London, where I honed my skills in design, problem-solving, and project management. This experience has given me a strong foundation in understanding user needs, attention to detail, and the ability to translate complex ideas into functional, meaningful spaces.       
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m looking to transition into software development, driven by the desire to combine my passion for creativity with the logical aspects of coding. Much like architecture, web development allows me to create engaging, interactive experiences that people can connect with. I’m particularly excited by the problem-solving aspect of coding, where I can apply my architectural mindset to tackle new challenges in an evolving digital world.
    </p>
    <p>I’m eager to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I look forward to collaborating on exciting projects that bridge creativity and technology. Outside of development, I have a keen interest in photography, which further fuels my passion for design and visual storytelling.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I hope you enjoy exploring my work and the journey I’m on as I dive into the world of software development.</p>
