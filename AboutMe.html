        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>
            Hello! I’m Nick Chua. I'm originally from Brunei and now based in the UK. As a former architect, I’ve led several large-scale projects in London and allowed me to develop my skills in design, problem-solving, and project management. My architectural experience has given me a strong foundation in understanding user needs, attention to detail, and the ability to translate complex ideas into functional, meaningful spaces.       
        </p>

        <h5>Why I Want To Be A Developer</h5>

        <p>
            I want to become a developer because I enjoy coding and problem-solving. Like architecture, web development allows me to create engaging, interactive experiences that people can connect with. I’m excited by the problem-solving aspect of coding, where I can apply my architectural mindset to tackle new challenges. I'm looking forward to learning more and building on the skills I've learned so far. 
        </p>

        <p>I’m eager to continue learning and growing as a developer. In my free time, I enjoy photography and visual storytelling.</p>
        <h5>What I've Learned So Far</h5>
        <p> Over the past few months, I've been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've built a portfolio website, a game and have used codewars and Codeacademy to practice and learn the fundamentals of coding.</p>
