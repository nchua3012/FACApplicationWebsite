        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>
            I'm originally from Brunei and now based in the UK. As a former architect, I’ve led several large-scale projects in London and allowed me to develop my skills in design, problem-solving, and project management. My architectural experience has given me a strong foundation in understanding user needs, attention to detail, and the ability to translate complex ideas into functional, meaningful spaces.       
        </p>

        <h5>Why I Want To Be A Developer</h5>

        <p>
            I want to become a developer because I enjoy coding, problem-solving, and working within teams to achieve shared goals. Similar to architecture, coding involves analyzing problems and creating functional solutions within constraints. Both fields rely on an iterative process of prototyping, testing, and refining to achieve the best results. 

        <p>I’m eager to continue learning and growing as a developer. In my free time, I enjoy photography and visual storytelling.</p>

        <h5>What I've Learned So Far</h5>
        <p> Over the past few months, I've been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've built a portfolio website, a fighting game and have used Codewars and Codeacademy to practice and learn the fundamentals of coding.</p>
